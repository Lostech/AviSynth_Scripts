Install the script(s) in the AviSynth Plugins folder for auto-loading or use the Import() function in your own script.

Available scripts:

DollyZoom:			an effect for applying a very simplified DollyZoom (also known as "Vertigo" effect)

DollyZoom_V2:		an effect which creates a simplified DollyZoom with 3 shifted planes

PictureInPicture:	plugin with several Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and Picture-and-Picture (PaP) functions (smiliar to TV PiP/PaP)

TextOverlay:		text overlay functions for e.g. for titles or subtitles

Remark:
Keep in mind that these scripts are no professional effect filters and work is still in progress. ;)
